        <h3>The problem:</h3>
        <h4>
          As a player, I want to add an obstacle to the
          game map so that I have something to avoid.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Our acceptance criteria (the criteria we use to
          know when we're done) looks like this:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Given that my character moves towards an obstacle in
              any direction
              <br>
              When it hits the obstacle
              <br>
              Then my character stops moving
            </li>
            <li>
              Given there are two obstacles on the screen
              <br>
              And there is not enough space between them for the
              character to pass through
              <br>
              When I move my character between the obstacles
              <br>
              Then my character should pass between them
            </li>

          <p>
            Our basic approach when writing code using Test Drived Development
            can be summed up as the red, green, refactor cycle. First we think
            about what we're trying to do and break it down into the smallest
            possible chunks. Starting with the first bit, we write a test for it.
            The test will fail (red). Then we write
            <em>just enough</em>
            code to make the test pass (green). It is really important only to write
            enough to make the tests pass. Once we've got our tests passing, then we
            can safely refactor our new code knowing we will know if we've broken it.
            After this we can move on to the next of the small chunks of
            functionality and repeat the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            It'll make more sense when we start doing it, so let's put it into action!

          <h3>So, what do we do first?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class='step-content'>
          <p>
            Let's have a think about how we're going to approach the problem:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We have to add an obstacle
            </li>
            <li>
              We need to detect when the player hits the obstacle
            </li>
            <li>
              We need to prevent the player from moving through the obstacle.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Lucky for us, the collision detection is already done.
            That just means we have to worry about stopping the player,
            and adding an actual obstacle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's tackle stopping the player first.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few different ways to stop the player:
            <ul>
              <li>
                We could set a flag to block movement in a certain direction
                but this will require us to know on which side the collision
                is occuring - this will require us to rewrite our collision
                detection system. Let's go for something that will meet our
                requirements with much less work.
              </li>
              <li>
                The simplest way to block the player when they collide with
                an obstacle, is to move them back to the last coordinates before the
                collision - if the game loop is running quickly, then the
                player won't even notice their character jumping back and forth.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            So what do we need for this? First, we need to store the last position, and
            then we need to move the player on a collision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we've broken our task know what we need, let's write a test!
          </p>

          <h3>Testing first</h3>
          <img src='/assets/img/page-structure/course/dot.png'>
        </div>
        <div class='step-content'>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- spec/player_spec.lua:59&#x000A;&#x000A;describe(&quot;lastPosition&quot;, function()&#x000A;    it(&quot;should store the last position before moving vertically&quot;, function()&#x000A;        orig_x = 10&#x000A;        orig_y = 10&#x000A;        local player = Player:new(&#x000A;            mock_input('up'),&#x000A;            {&#x000A;                x = orig_x,&#x000A;                y = orig_y,&#x000A;                speed = 1&#x000A;            }&#x000A;        )&#x000A;        player:update(dt)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.are.same(player.lastPosition, {x = orig_x, y = orig_y})&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;end)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            What we're actually trying to test is that if we put the player at a coordinate and then
            move it one unit, that the player keeps track of its last position.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this test, we set up what we need by creating our player
            with a mocked 'up' input command, and x and y values. Then we tell the player to
            update itself. Finally we make an assertion that the player's last position is
            its original position.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the test is written, you should run the test suite to see the test fail.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>$ busted&#x000A;&#x000A;++++++++++x++++++++++++++&#x000A;24 successes, 1 failure, and 0 pending in 0.005651 seconds.&#x000A;&#x000A;Failure ./spec/player_spec.lua @ 60&#x000A;should store the last position before moving vertically&#x000A;./spec/player_spec.lua:73: attempt to call field 'lastPosition' (a nil value)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            You'll see an error message something like the one above (or perhaps something about
            attempting to index a nil value). Both messages just mean the table index you're
            trying to look up doesn't exist). We're looking for a test failure, but this is the
            wrong kind of failure, so let's fix it up.
          </p>
          <p>
            All we need to do to get this test failing in the right way is to add in the
            <em>lastPosition</em>
            indicies onto the Player class.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>

          </div>
          <p>
            Now if we run busted again we should see a different error message.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>  $ busted&#x000A;&#x000A;  +++++++++++x+++++++++++++&#x000A;  23 successes, 1 failure, and 0 pending in 0.005475 seconds.&#x000A;&#x000A;  Failure: ./spec/player_spec.lua @ 60&#x000A;  should store the last position before moving vertically&#x000A;  ./spec/player_spec.lua:73: Expected objects to be the same.

          </div>
          <p>
            Our test isn't crashing, and busted is telling us that our actual output
            doesn't match our expected output. Now we can make it pass!
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- player.lua:71&#x000A;&#x000A;function Player:update(dt)&#x000A;    ...&#x000A;&#x000A;    # line 101&#x000A;    self.lastPosition = {&#x000A;        y = self.y&#x000A;    }&#x000A;&#x000A;    ...&#x000A;end</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            And now if we run our tests:
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>$ busted&#x000A;&#x000A;+++++++++++++++++++++++++&#x000A;25 successes, 0 failures, and 0 pending in 0.004932 seconds.</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Great! We're on our way. Now let's add another test to cover moving
            in a horizonal direction. We'll put it in the same describe block.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- spec/player_spec:59&#x000A;&#x000A;describe(&quot;lastPosition&quot;, function()&#x000A;  it(&quot;should store the last position before moving vertically&quot;, function()&#x000A;      ...&#x000A;  end)&#x000A;&#x000A;  # line 76&#x000A;  it(&quot;should store the last position before moving horizonally&quot;, function()&#x000A;      orig_x = 10&#x000A;      orig_y = 10&#x000A;      local player = Player:new(&#x000A;          mock_input('left'),&#x000A;          {&#x000A;              x = orig_x,&#x000A;              y = orig_y,&#x000A;              speed = 1&#x000A;          }&#x000A;      )&#x000A;      player.graphics.animation = mock_animation()&#x000A;&#x000A;      player:update(dt)&#x000A;&#x000A;      assert.are.same(player.lastPosition, {x = orig_x, y = orig_y})&#x000A;  end)&#x000A;end)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            The main difference with this test is that we need to mock out the
            player's animation since it is called when we change horizontal
            direction. Given our implementation, this test should already pass,
            but we add it for completeness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that a player can keep track of its last position we can move it
            back to that position if it collides with something.

          <p>
            Our collision detection system (see main.lua:25 and entity.lua:30)
            will already tell us when the player has hit something. All we need
            to do is code what should happen when the player hits something. So,
            as usual, let's write a test.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- spec/player_spec:143&#x000A;&#x000A;describe(&quot;collide&quot;, function()&#x000A;    it(&quot;should move the player to its last position when colliding on the left side, function()&#x000A;        player = Player:new({})&#x000A;        player.size = {&#x000A;            x = 10,&#x000A;            y = 10&#x000A;        }&#x000A;        player.lastPosition = {x = 21, y = 10}&#x000A;        player.x = 20&#x000A;        player.y = 10&#x000A;        player.graphics.animation = mock_animation()&#x000A;&#x000A;        collidingEntity = Entity:new({})&#x000A;&#x000A;        player:collide(collidingEntity)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.x, 21)&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.y, 10)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;end)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Here, we're setting up our preconditions: a player with a
            known last postion, and an entity for it to collide with.
            Next, we collide our new player with the entity. And finally
            we assert that our player was moved back to its last position.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we run our tests now, busted will complain about the
            player:collide() function not existing. We'd better add
            the method to make sure out tests will fail for the right
            reasons.

            This is just enough code to make the tests pass, but won't cover us if we move
            up or down. So let's write another test.
          </p>

            Our tests should all be passing again. Let's have another look at our
            test code:
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- spec/player_spec:143&#x000A;&#x000A;describe(&quot;collide&quot;, function()&#x000A;    it(&quot;should move the player to its last position when colliding on the left side, function()&#x000A;        player = Player:new({})&#x000A;        player.size = {&#x000A;            x = 10,&#x000A;            y = 10&#x000A;        }&#x000A;        player.lastPosition = {x = 21, y = 10}&#x000A;        player.x = 20&#x000A;        player.y = 10&#x000A;        player.graphics.animation = mock_animation()&#x000A;&#x000A;        collidingEntity = Entity:new({})&#x000A;&#x000A;        player:collide(collidingEntity)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.x, 21)&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.y, 10)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;&#x000A;    it(&quot;should move the player to its last position when colliding on the top side&quot;, function()&#x000A;        player = Player:new({})&#x000A;        player.size = {&#x000A;            x = 10,&#x000A;            y = 10&#x000A;        }&#x000A;        player.lastPosition = {x = 10, y = 11}&#x000A;        player.x = 20&#x000A;        player.y = 10&#x000A;&#x000A;        collidingEntity = Entity:new({})&#x000A;&#x000A;        player:collide(collidingEntity)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.x, 10)&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.y, 11)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;end)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            You might notice that we've got some duplicated code here. The instantiation of the
            player and the collidingEntity are in both tests, so we
            can move them out into a before_each block which will be run
            before each test in the current context (our describe("collide") block).
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- spec/player_spec:143&#x000A;&#x000A;describe(&quot;collide&quot;, function()&#x000A;    local player, collidingEntity&#x000A;&#x000A;    before_each(function()&#x000A;        player = Player:new({})&#x000A;        player.size = {&#x000A;            x = 10,&#x000A;            y = 10&#x000A;        }&#x000A;        player.x = 20&#x000A;        player.y = 10&#x000A;&#x000A;        collidingEntity = Entity:new({})&#x000A;        collidingEntity.x = 10&#x000A;        collidingEntity.y = 10&#x000A;        collidingEntity.size = {&#x000A;            x = 10,&#x000A;            y = 10&#x000A;        }&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;&#x000A;    it(&quot;should move the player to its last position when colliding on the left side&quot;, function()&#x000A;        player.graphics.animation = mock_animation()&#x000A;&#x000A;        player.lastPosition = {x = 21, y = 10}&#x000A;&#x000A;        player:collide(collidingEntity)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.x, 21)&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.y, 10)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;&#x000A;    it(&quot;should move the player to its last position when colliding on the top side&quot;, function()&#x000A;        player.lastPosition = {x = 10, y = 11}&#x000A;&#x000A;        player:collide(collidingEntity)&#x000A;&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.x, 10)&#x000A;        assert.is.equal(player.y, 11)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;end)</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Our test cases are much cleaner now. At this point we should also run our
            tests to make sure they still pass.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still need to add a few more tests for the collide function to cover
            the other two movement cases - they're similar to the cases we've got already
            and they should pass without adding more production code. See the latest version
            of the player spec at line 143.

            So now we've stopped our player from moving through another entity,
            and some tests that guarantee that it works. Let's now wire it up
            to the game itself, so we can see it in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we'll need something to add to the game. Obstacles are something
            that we're likely to reuse and and have more specialised behaviour
            than an entity, so let's make a new class. Let's add a new file in
            the project root called obstacle.lua.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- obstacle.lua&#x000A;&#x000A;require 'entity'&#x000A;&#x000A;Obstacle = {}&#x000A;Obstacle.__index = Obstacle&#x000A;setmetatable(Obstacle, {__index = Entity})</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Here we set up our inheritance chain.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>function Obstacle:new(game, config)&#x000A;    local config = config or {}&#x000A;&#x000A;    local newObstacle = Entity:new(game)&#x000A;    newObstacle.type = &quot;obstacle&quot;&#x000A;    newObstacle.x = config.x or 0&#x000A;    newObstacle.y = config.y or 0&#x000A;    newObstacle.size = config.size or {&#x000A;        x = 40,&#x000A;        y = 52&#x000A;    }</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            More inheritance and our overrides.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>    newObstacle.graphics = config.graphics or {&#x000A;        source = &quot;assets/images/cactus-sprites.png&quot;&#x000A;    }</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            We're setting up the sprite file we want to use for our obstacle.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>    if game.graphics ~=nil and game.animation ~= nil then&#x000A;        newObstacle.graphics.sprites = game.graphics.newImage(newObstacle.graphics.source)&#x000A;        newObstacle.graphics.grid = game.animation.newGrid(&#x000A;            newObstacle.size.x, newObstacle.size.y,&#x000A;            newObstacle.graphics.sprites:getWidth(),&#x000A;            newObstacle.graphics.sprites:getHeight()&#x000A;        )&#x000A;        newObstacle.graphics.animation = game.animation.newAnimation(&#x000A;            newObstacle.graphics.grid(&quot;1-2&quot;, 1),&#x000A;            0.5&#x000A;        )&#x000A;    end</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            This will set up the animation for our sprite. We set up a new grid that is the
            same size as our obstacle and then the animation itself with 2 frames, starting
            on the first with each frame lasting for half a second.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>    return setmetatable(newObstacle, self)&#x000A;end</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            The last thing we do in our Obstacle:new() is to attach the newObstacle we've
            just created to the metatable of the Obstacle table. If that doesn't make sense
            then think of it as more boilerplate that we need to make inheritance work.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>function Obstacle:update(dt)&#x000A;    if self.graphics.animation ~= nil then&#x000A;        self.graphics.animation:update(dt)&#x000A;    end&#x000A;end</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Finally, we add an update method for the obstacle, which will
            handle the animation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we've got an obstacle "class", we still need to instatiate it
            on the game map.
          </p>
          <div class='code'>
            
            <pre><code>-- main.lua:9&#x000A;&#x000A;local obstacle = Obstacle:new(love, {x = 200, y = 200})&#x000A;&#x000A;function love.load()&#x000A;    table.insert(entities, player)&#x000A;    table.insert(entities, obstacle)&#x000A;&#x000A;    ...</code></pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Now we've got everything we need to display an obstacle on the
            game map. Run it (love .) to see your new dancing cactus. The player
            character should not be able to run into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage we're passing part one of our acceptance criteria, so
            I'll leave it as an exercise to modify the code to pass the second
            part.
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy coding!
