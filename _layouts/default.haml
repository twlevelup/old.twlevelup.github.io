            The LevelUp program bridges the gap between what is
            taught at University, and what happens on the ground in software
            projects. Learn essential skills from people who do this not just
            %em for
            a living, but as a living.

                Over 9 weeks, you'll deliver a project from start to finish,
                guided by highly experienced professionals. We'll teach you
                everything you need to know along the way, from planning and
                design to writing and testing your own code. At the end you
                won't just walk away with working software for your portfolio -
                you'll have knowledge, skills and experience to hit the ground
                running in the workplace.
